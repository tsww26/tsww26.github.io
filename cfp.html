        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The issue of online violence against women and girls has reached critical levels globally, affecting safety, mental health, and social participation in digital spaces. Women continue to face significant risks in digital spaces, ranging from hateful content to the misuse of emerging technologies such as Generative AI. This creates an urgent need to anticipate and mitigate future risks before harms become entrenched.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second edition of the Towards a Safer Web for Women (TSWW’26) workshop, co-located with The Web Science Conference 2026, aims to bring together an interdisciplinary community of researchers and practitioners to examine emerging threats to women’s online safety and explore proactive, forward-looking mitigation strategies.        </p>
        <p>
          Building on this, the workshop will provide a space to reflect on recent progress in addressing online violence against women, identify emerging challenges linked to new and evolving technologies, and discuss proactive, interdisciplinary approaches to anticipate, prevent, and mitigate future harms. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forecasting and modelling emerging risks for women in future digital ecosystems (e.g., AI agents, autonomous platforms, immersive worlds)</li>
          <li>Anticipating harms posed by generative AI towards women, including automated harassment, AI impersonation, and large-scale manipulation</li>
          <li>Safety-by-design strategies for upcoming technologies (e.g., LLMs, VR/AR environments, agentic AI systems)</li>
          <li>Interdisciplinary methodologies for horizon scanning and technology foresight related to gender-based online harm</li>
          <li>Detection and prevention of gender-based online violence (e.g., harassment, stalking, cyberbullying)</li>
          <li>Sentiment and emotion analysis in abusive or harmful online interactions towards women</li>
          <li>Cross-cultural perspectives on online safety and gender-based violence</li>
          <li>Gender bias identification and mitigation in AI</li>
          <li>Multilingual and multicultural approaches to identifying and addressing online harm towards women</li>
          <li>Human-centered approaches for online safety applications</li>
          <li>Studies on the psychological impact of online harms</li>
          <li>Intersectional approaches to understanding and mitigating online harms faced by women with multiple marginalised identities (e.g., misogynoir, LGBTQ+ women, or women from religious, class or cultural minorities)</li>
          <li>Analysis of tracking devices, surveillance tools, and hidden cameras misused against women</li>
          <li>Principles and case studies for integrating safety by design in social platforms and online services</li>
          <li>Detection and mitigation of non-consensual deepfake generation and dissemination</li>
          <li>Legal and ethical frameworks for protecting women online</li>
          <li>Psychological, social, and legal impacts of technology when used for gender-based abuse</li>

        </ul>
